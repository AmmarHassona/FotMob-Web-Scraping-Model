# FotMob-Web-Scraping-Model
The aim of this project was to find out how data is scraped from football data websites like FotMob. I wanted to scrape the data that I would be able to use for later use for machine learning models 
or for data analysis. This model used Jude Bellingham as an example however any player can be used for this model as long as the id of the player on the FotMob website is changed in the params accordingly.
I will use this model to analyze certain players' performances using data analysis and data visualization. 

FotMob: https://www.fotmob.com/

Jude Bellingham Page used: https://www.fotmob.com/players/1077894/jude-bellingham

Feel free to use this code as long as you credit me :)
